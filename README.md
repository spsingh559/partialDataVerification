Verifying partial Data sharing using Merkle Tree algorithm

In a identity management based solution in blockchain, How do you verify the PII information shared by one user is authentic or not. For ex. in Hyperledger Indy, PII information is stored in user wallet and when user share data with any verifying agency, verifying agency can verify the partial data of whole PII information by signature proof stored in blockchain ledger.

I am using merkle tree algoithm to achieve same functionality.

How to use this solution :

npm install
cd merkleWithRoot/
node index.js
